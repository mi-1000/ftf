Saul then said to him who bore his weapons, "Put out your sword, and pierce me, lest these uncircumcised men come to me, and cause me to suffer their reproaches; and he who bore his weapons will not; for he was afraid; and Saul took his sword, and cast himself on it.
Il qui avait les armées de Saul, le vêque d'était, se l'établée, se l'établée, et il dirent.

The next day, the Philistines came to strip the dead, and found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
They stripped him, and carried his head and his weapons, and sent word of this good tidings throughout the land of the Philistines to their idols and to the people.

Saul died, for he was guilty of infidelity to the LORD, for whom he did not keep the word, and for which he enquired, and enquired, and enquired, and enquired of those who conjured up the dead.
